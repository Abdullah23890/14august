          <p class="my-3 text-dark text-center">🌟 <strong> Pride of Pakistan </strong>🌟 </p> 

Every nation has heroes who bring pride and honor to their country. These people are remembered for their sacrifices, their services, and their dedication. In Pakistan, such individuals are called “Fakhr-e-Pakistan” – the Pride of Pakistan. They are the shining stars who inspire the nation with their achievements and values.

Whether it is the battlefield, science, education, charity, or literature the Pride of Pakistan has left their mark on every field. They rise above personal gains and work selflessly for the betterment of the country and its people.

One of the greatest examples is <strong>Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah</strong>, who gave us Pakistan through his visionary leadership. Another legendary figure is Abdul Sattar Edhi, the greatest humanitarian in Pakistan’s history, who dedicated his life to serving the poor. 

<strong>No religion is higher than humanity Abdul Sattar Edhi</strong>

In science, <strong>Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan </strong>, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program, made the country strong and secure. In education, <strong>Malala Yousafzai </strong> made history as the youngest Nobel Prize winner and stood up for girls' rights.

These heroes show us that being the Pride of Pakistan is not just about fame it's about character, contribution, and commitment.

     History is illuminated by the names of a few extraordinary individuals who, through wisdom, determination, and integrity, change the destiny of nations. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was one such towering figure, who not only laid the foundation of a new country but also gave millions of Muslims a distinct identity and the gift of freedom.
<br>
<strong>Early Life</strong><br>

Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born on 25th December 1876 in Karachi. His father’s name was Poonja Jinnah, a businessman by profession. Jinnah received his early education in Karachi and Bombay (now Mumbai). From a very young age, he showed signs of intelligence and a deep desire to learn.
<br>
<strong>Education and Law</strong><br>

At the age of 16, Jinnah went to London to study law, where he enrolled at Lincoln’s Inn. There, he excelled in his studies and also gained a deep understanding of British culture and politics. After returning to India, he began practicing law in Bombay and soon became one of the most prominent lawyers in the subcontinent.

<br>
<strong>Beginning of Political Life</strong><br>

Jinnah began his political career in 1906 with the Indian National Congress. His main goal was to promote Hindu-Muslim unity. However, over time he realized that the rights of Muslims were being neglected.

He then joined the All-India Muslim League and transformed it into a powerful political party. In 1940, during the historic Lahore Resolution, the demand for a separate Muslim state—Pakistan—was formally made.
<br>
<strong>Founder of Pakistan</strong><br>

Despite facing countless challenges, opposition, and political pressure, Jinnah’s leadership remained firm. Through his unmatched vision, strategy, and honesty, he succeeded in turning the dream of Pakistan into reality. Under his leadership, the Muslims of the subcontinent launched a historic movement that eventually led to the creation of Pakistan on 14th August 1947.

He is rightfully called “Quaid-e-Azam” (The Great Leader)—a title that reflects the respect and admiration people have for him.
<br>
<strong>Death</strong><br>

Sadly, just over a year after the creation of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam passed away on 11th September 1948. However, his mission, his ideals, and his vision live on in the heart of every Pakistani.

    In the pages of history, there are few individuals whose ideas spark revolutions and whose words awaken entire nations. Allama Muhammad Iqbal was one such remarkable thinker, philosopher, and poet, who envisioned the birth of a separate homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent long before it became a reality.
<br>
<strong>Early Life</strong><br>

Allama Iqbal was born on 9th November 1877 in Sialkot, Punjab. His father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad, was a pious man with deep spiritual inclinations. From an early age, Iqbal showed exceptional intelligence and a love for poetry and learning. His early education took place in Sialkot, after which he moved to Lahore for higher studies.
<br>

<strong>Education and Philosophy</strong> <br>

Iqbal studied at Government College Lahore, where he earned a Master's degree in Philosophy. Later, he went to Europe to further his education, studying in England and Germany. He earned a degree in law from Cambridge and a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Munich. His exposure to Western thought, combined with his deep understanding of Islamic values, helped him develop a unique philosophical outlook that would shape the future of the Muslim Ummah.
<br>

<strong>A Voice for the Muslims</strong><br>

Upon returning to India, Iqbal used his poetry and speeches to awaken the political consciousness of Muslims. He believed that Islam was not just a religion but a complete code of life. Through powerful verses in Persian and Urdu, he urged Muslims to rediscover their identity, strength, and unity. His famous poems like Shikwa, Jawab-e-Shikwa, and Lab Pe Aati Hai Dua Ban Ke Tamanna Meri are still etched in the hearts of millions.
<br>

<strong>The Dream of Pakistan</strong>

In 1930, during his presidential address at the Allahabad session of the All-India Muslim League, Iqbal presented the idea of a separate homeland for Muslims—a place where they could live freely according to their faith and values. This was the first formal vision of what would later become Pakistan. His idea deeply influenced Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and played a vital role in the Pakistan Movement.
<br>
<strong>Legacy</strong><br>

Allama Iqbal passed away on 21st April 1938, years before the creation of Pakistan. Yet, his dream lived on. He is remembered not only as the Shair-e-Mashriq (Poet of the East), but also as the spiritual father of Pakistan. His thoughts, philosophy, and poetry continue to inspire generations of Pakistanis to strive for unity, justice, and self-respect.

History remembers those rare individuals who guide their people through times of darkness and despair. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was one such visionary who dedicated his life to the educational and intellectual upliftment of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. His efforts laid the foundation for a modern and progressive Muslim society.
<br>

<strong>Early Life</strong><br>

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was born on 17th October 1817 in Delhi into a respected and educated family. His father, Syed Muttaqi, was a man of spiritual and literary interests. From a young age, Sir Syed displayed a deep interest in learning and gained knowledge in various subjects including Persian, Arabic, and later English.
<br>
<strong>Service and Realization</strong><br>

Sir Syed worked as a civil servant under British rule. During his service, he closely observed the widening gap between the British and the Muslim population, especially after the War of Independence in 1857. He realized that Muslims were falling behind due to a lack of modern education and understanding of the changing world.
<br>

<strong>Champion of Education</strong><br>

Believing that education was the key to progress, Sir Syed emphasized the need for Muslims to adopt modern, scientific, and rational learning. In 1875, he established the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College in Aligarh, which later became Aligarh Muslim University. This institution aimed to provide a balanced education combining Western knowledge with Islamic values.
<br>

<strong>Movement for Social and Intellectual Reform</strong><br>

Sir Syed also founded the Scientific Society to translate Western works into Urdu, making them accessible to the common Muslim. Through his magazine Tehzeeb-ul-Ikhlaq, he encouraged intellectual discussions and social reform. He believed that Muslims needed to develop a new mindset—one that embraced progress while remaining rooted in their identity.
<br>

<strong>Legacy</strong><br>

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan passed away on 27th March 1898. However, his mission did not end with his death. His vision greatly influenced later leaders like Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Today, he is remembered as the architect of modern Muslim thought in South Asia—a reformer who woke up a sleeping nation and led it toward the path of progress.

       In the early years of Pakistan’s history, when the country was struggling to find its footing, one man stood beside Quaid-e-Azam with loyalty, courage, and vision. That man was Liaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan. His leadership helped shape the foundation of a newly born nation and guided it through its earliest and most challenging years.
<br>

<strong>Early Life and Education</strong><br>

Liaquat Ali Khan was born on 1st October 1895 in Karnal, India, into a well-educated and noble family. He received his early education in India and later went to England, where he studied law and political science at Oxford University. After completing his studies, he returned to India and entered public life with a firm belief in justice, equality, and freedom.
<br>

<strong>Political Career and Role in the Freedom Movement</strong> <br>

Liaquat Ali Khan joined the All-India Muslim League and quickly became one of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s most trusted companions. He played a crucial role in the Pakistan Movement and worked tirelessly to gain the support of Muslims across the subcontinent. His speeches and political efforts inspired unity and determination among the people.
<br>

<strong>First Prime Minister of Pakistan</strong> <br>

When Pakistan was created on 14th August 1947, Liaquat Ali Khan was appointed the first Prime Minister of the country. He worked hard to build the nation’s political and economic systems from scratch. Under his leadership, Pakistan adopted its first Objectives Resolution in 1949, which laid the foundation for the future constitution of the country and highlighted the importance of Islam in Pakistan’s legal and political framework.
<br>

Liaquat Ali Khan also played a vital role in shaping Pakistan’s foreign policy. In 1950, he visited the United States, making it Pakistan’s first major diplomatic visit to a world power. He believed in maintaining friendly relations with all nations while protecting Pakistan’s sovereignty and national interests.
<br>

<strong>Martyrdom and Legacy</strong> <br>

On 16th October 1951, Liaquat Ali Khan was tragically assassinated during a public gathering in Rawalpindi. His untimely death shocked the entire nation. He is remembered as "Shaheed-e-Millat" (Martyr of the Nation) for his unwavering service and sacrifice for Pakistan.

        Abdul Sattar Edhi was not just a name; he was a movement, a symbol of hope, and a shining example of compassion and selflessness. Known as the "Angel of Mercy" and "Pakistan’s Mother Teresa," Edhi dedicated his entire life to serving humanity without any discrimination of race, religion, or nationality.
<br>

<strong>Early Life and Struggles</strong> <br>

Abdul Sattar Edhi was born in 1928 in Bantva, a small town in Gujarat, India. From a very young age, he witnessed the suffering of the poor and the sick, which deeply affected him. After the partition of India in 1947, he migrated to Karachi, Pakistan, with his family. There, he experienced poverty and hardship firsthand, but these difficulties only strengthened his resolve to help those in need.

He began his journey of humanitarian work with a single idea: to serve humanity. With very little money but a heart full of compassion, he bought a small van and began providing medical aid to the poor. This was the humble beginning of what would later become the Edhi Foundation.
<br>

<strong>The Edhi Foundation</strong> <br>

The Edhi Foundation, founded in 1951, is now the largest and most organized charitable organization in Pakistan. It operates entirely on private donations and has never accepted government or foreign aid. The foundation provides a wide range of services, including:
<br>
Free hospitals and medical clinics>Ambulance services (the world’s largest volunteer ambulance fleet) <br>

 <br>
Lifestyle and Values <br>

Despite the massive success of his foundation, Abdul Sattar Edhi lived a simple and humble life. He wore simple clothes, lived in a small room adjacent to his clinic, and never used the foundation’s money for personal gain. His wife, Bilquis Edhi, was his strongest supporter and played a key role in managing many of the organization’s operations, especially the orphanages and maternity services.
<br>
Edhi was known for his integrity, honesty, and unwavering dedication. He worked tirelessly, often driving ambulances himself and personally washing and burying the bodies of the deceased. He spent every moment of his life in service to others.

Lenin Peace Prize <br>

UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize <br>
